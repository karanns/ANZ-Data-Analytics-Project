# ANZ-Data-Analytics-Project

Task 1
This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.


Task 2
Predictive Analytics
Explore correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a prediction model based on the findings.
